### Day 15 29 April 2018

### Day 17 01 May 2018
**Progress**: Working on JavaScript intermediate algorithms

**Thoughts**: Ouch*3 (does that count+1?)

### Day 18 02 May 2018
**Progress**: Fixed my broken algorithm

**Thoughts**: Only managed 5 minutes today - but better than no minutes...

### Day 19 03 May 2018
**Progress**: Feeling lazy so lazy coding it is

**Thoughts**: Decided against regExp and used a nifty switch instead

### Day 20 04 May 2018
**Progress**: Star Wars day today :)

**Thoughts**:still working on algorithms and losing focus a little - might do some web develeopment tomorrow - a change is as good as a rest 

### Day 21 05 May 2018
**Progress**: Still algorithms

**Thoughts**:Tired today - so just some more algorithms

### Day 22 06 May 2018
**Progress**: Still algorithms

**Thoughts**:Two more intermediate algorithms to go :)

### Day 23 07 May 2018
**Progress**: Intermediate algorithms

**Thoughts**:Yay - intermediate algorithms done :)

### Day 24 08 May 2018
**Progress**: working late so only managed two advanced algorithms (not very well)

**Thoughts**:JavaScript advanced algorithms - bit tired for this today - try again tomorrow

### Day 25 09 May 2018
**Progress**: working late so only managed 1 advanced algorithm 

**Thoughts**:It doesn't like my forEach - will look with fresh eyes tommorrow

### Day 26 10 May 2018
**Progress**: Wow -  these algorithms are getting big! 

**Thoughts**:Still toiling - hoping to finish algorithms by the end of the week

### Day 27 11 May 2018
**Progress**: Finally an algorithm I know! 

**Thoughts**:Well that was kind of annoying - commented out bob.setFirstName("Haskell");
then bob.getFirstName(); worked. I wonder why it saw it as an error when it wasn't....

 ### Day 28 12 May 2018
**Progress**: Moved on to pastures new. 

**Thoughts**:Moved on from JavaScript algorithms with a couple to go back to later. Working on the calculator project at #freeCodeCamp
